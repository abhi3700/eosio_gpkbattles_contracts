- associate game_fee with card type. Create a utility func 
```cpp
asset compute_gamefee(card_id) {
  if (cardid->category == exotic && cardid->variant == base)
    game_fee = "5 WAX";
  else if (cardid->category == exotic && cardid->variant == prism)
    game_fee = "10 WAX";

  return game_fee;  
}
```
  - this `game_fee` variable can be further added as game_fee required during `pairwplayer()` ACTION i.e. while adding the `game_fee` as one of the fields in `ongamestat` table row.
- a ACTION program `resetall` (in cpp) for resetting the game in bash
  - if there is any game_id, then 
    - capture the players, card ids
    - make card_ids available, if set selected. 
    - remove the players from players_table. 
- add multiple cases of checks params - category, variant, quality, etc..of cards in static function inside .hpp files
   Case-1: exotic, base, A/B
   Case-2: exotic, prism, A/B
